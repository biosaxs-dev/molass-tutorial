    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already used some optimizations implicitly in several parts of implementation. Most of them are simple enough to be completed in several seconds. Although such simple optimizations can provide useful results for easy cases, they are not powerful enough for many other cases where component peaks are not visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those hard-to-analyze cases, the problem gets underdetermined, meaning there are so many possible solutions that we are not sure which one is appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can utilize SEC and SAXS theories to reduce the solution space. More concretely, we can add constraints based on the theories. For example, in plain words, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Larger particles elute faster than smaller ones,\n",
    "* Peaks broaden as they stay longer in the column,\n",
    "* Reconstructed Rg curve should be consistent with observed Rg curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can impose these constraints by adding parameters, using advanced models and adopting global optimization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will show how to use such rigorous optimizations leaving the detailed discussion elsewhere."
