    "# Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Molass Library is designed to achieve the following motto:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a quote from Larry Wall, the creator of the Perl language.\n",
    "Although Perl gave way to Python and we will use Python, this motto is ubiquitous in software library design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in this chapter, we will show the easy part to give an idea of what it is all about.\n",
    "If the input data are well conditioned, this will suffice to get what you will expect in ordinary use.\n",
    "However, life is not so easy and that is why the hard part exists, which we will discuss in the later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume you have already installed Python and you are familiar with [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the Molass Library package, you can use pip as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "pip install -U molass\n",
    "pip install -U molass_data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The molass_data package includes some data sets for this tutorial.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "For programming in Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend either of the following tools (other alternatives are also possible):\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)\n",
    "* [Jupyter Extension in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using Jupyter notebooks mainly for the following reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interactive Exploration with Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks let you write and run code in small, manageable cells. You can experiment with different parameters, immediately see the results, and iteratively refine your analysisâ€”most importantly, **all of this without restarting your workflow from scratch**. This makes it easy to test ideas, debug, and learn by doing.\n"
