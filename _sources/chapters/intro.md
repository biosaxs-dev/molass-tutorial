# Molass Library Tutorial

Molass Library is a rewrite of [MOLASS](https://pfwww.kek.jp/saxs/MOLASSE.html), a tool for the analysis of SEC-SAXS experiment data currently hosted at [Photon Factory](https://www2.kek.jp/imss/pf/eng/) and [SPring-8](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/), Japan. It is designed for scripting in Jupyter Notebooks, providing greater flexibility than its predecessor thanks to the diversity of Python ecosystem.
